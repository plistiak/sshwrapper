!!DEPRECATED!!
This project is marked as deprecated. You get better functionality with Host directive in /etc/ssh/ssh_config or ~/.ssh/config.

I use this script on Unix-like servers where DNS doesn't work correctly 
and I have not root rights to update /etc/hosts. In simple text file
is list of hostnames and IP addresses separated via semicolon, each
on one line.
